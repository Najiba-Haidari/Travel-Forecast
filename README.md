# User Acceptance Criteria 

User Stories : 
As an avid hiker, I want to be able to search the hiking trails near a specified location (based on zip code)
When I find a location, I want to be able to see the weather forecast so I can prepare myself for an awesome hike !!
WHen we see the forecast, we can see sunset and sunrise time, humidity, air pressure, chance of rain, temperature 
When i look at the list of trails, I can see basic information about each hike such as the length, difficulty or general review.
When I search for trails, I can see a map dynamically populated showing the location of each given trail



# MVP 

As a user I want to see a search bar to input a zipcode
When I use the search bar I want to see a list of trails and the weather, specifically the temp and chance of rain
