//As a user I want to be able to pull up the page and see a search bar
    // add event listener to the search button
    // needs to perform a fetch for getLocation
    // if search is invalid show 404 error dynamically populated on the page

// When I input a search I see a 5 day forecast for the area along with a list of hiking trails nearby
    //fetch lat and lon through our geoCode API
    // use that data to create our URL for the five day forecast 
    // create divs and internal elements to host this information
    //dynamically populate the divs and elements

// When I look at the forecast I see temp, rain, wind, humidity, sunrise and sunset 
    //create "card" div with list or p elements to note all the specific weather information
    // use an API to show the weather icons

// When I look at the trails list, I can see photos of the trails and maybe links to trail websites or reviews
    // fetch API data to pull list of trails
    // get photos to populate with the trails on our page
